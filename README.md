## react-projects

### React projects and studies from 2016 Hello World to date.

#### Split to 5 categories:
1. 2017-2021 standalone projects.
2. 2018 udacity bootcamp projects.
3. 2022-2023 TypeScript smalls.
4. 2018-2019 react: feature studies, first steps
5. 2016-2017 deprecated: legacy, very first steps - they won't run.

### 1. **2017-2021 standalone projects.**

#### <a href="https://github.com/Bembit/amzn-dashboard/tree/main">**amazon-dashboard**</a>
- The reason `I choose React` from the "new frameworks" back `in 2016.`
- This was my after work side project for a while until I retired it in 2018. Details in repo.

#### <a href="/_ecommerce-admin-base">**_ecommerce-admin-base**</a>
- The moment of `"yeah, React is good now."`
- I almost fully rebuilt my bootcamp "readable" project with Hooks in a few days.
- CRUD, localstorage, modals, reusable forms, sorting, search.

#### <a href="/_webshop-redux">**_webshop-redux**</a>
- Webshop base, `Ecommerce with React, Redux and MongoDB.`
- Had everything, but a finished design and working payment methods integrated.

#### <a href="/_instagram-clone-firebase">**_instagram-clone-firebase**</a>
- Nothing magical React wise here.
- This was more about the start of my long lasting relationship with Google's `Firebase.`


#### <a href="/_frontend-image-uploads">**_frontend-image-uploads**</a>
- One of the `first frontends built in React` for an Express/Nodejs photo upload API from 2017/18. Not a DRY code.
- Included search and tag filters. The backend was more challenging.

### 2. **_udacity: 2018 bootcamp projects.**

#### <a href="/_udacity-readable">**_udacity-readable**</a>
- Udacity React bootcamp 3rd project. `Building a social media`, blog like site using `Redux.`
- Filters by tags, sorting, CRUD, comments on posts and likes / dislikes.

#### <a href="/_udacity-myreads">**_udacity-myreads**</a>
- Udacity React bootcamp 2nd project. To me, this was the hardest of the three.
- `Search an API` for books, and `add them to one of three states`: Want to read, In prog and Done.

#### <a href="/_udacity-contacts">**_udacity-contacts**</a>
- Udacity React bootcamp project, search an API for people, and add them to your contacts.
- Stateless, nothing extra apart from a search bar and some debounce.

### 3. **__ts: 2022-23 TypeScript stuff.**

#### <a href="/__ts-game-library">**__ts-game-library**</a>
- Like a game, store platform. Add game to library, remove, view library.
- Only one can be added, state can be managed from multiple views.

#### <a href="/__ts-skill-tree">**__ts-skill-tree**</a>
- RPG like talent / skill tree.

<img src="/zimages/4.png" width="30%">

#### <a href="/__ts-matching-game">**__ts-matching-game**</a>
- Matching game in TS, pair countries and capitals.
- Red flash on error, remove from dom on success.

<img src="/zimages/1.png" width="30%">

#### <a href="/__ts-food-ordering">**__ts-food-ordering**</a>
- Webshop comp in TS. Food items, and a cart. Adding, removing, deleting categories.

### 4. **react: legacy - they still run, 2018-19 era, maybe 20 with some hooks**
### 5. **depr: legacy - won't run, 2016-17 era.**
- These are `early concepts and studies of React` starting from late 2016, mid 2017.
- Very surprised that some of these actually run, like this first todo.
